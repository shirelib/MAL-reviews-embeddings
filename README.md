# MAL-reviews-embeddings
A personal project in which Distil-RoBERTa embeddings are created from MAL textual reviews, and cosine similarity is calculated for different tv shows.

This method can produce recommendations for shows to watch based on a favorite show. It is based on textual reviews which should reflect a deeper description and analysis of a show, unlike genres and other metadata.
